# Live-Object-Detection-Voice-Feedback
This project is a real-time object detection system that uses computer vision and text-to-speech technology to detect objects through a webcam and announce them using voice feedback.
It combines AI vision with accessibility-focused audio output, making it useful for assistive technology and smart environments.
